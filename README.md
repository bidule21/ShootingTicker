# ShootingTicker
###This repository contains three main parts:
**Client**
The client code which is used to upload a competition to the server.

**Server**
The server code, which is serving the live-ticker. Currently the server app is deployed using "google app engine", but it will probably work with any Tomcat server.

**SampleData**
This folder contains some sample export data, which was manually copied from real-life competitions.
